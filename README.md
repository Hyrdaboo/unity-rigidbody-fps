# unity-rigidbody-fps
A somewhat decent rigidbody based fps controller for unity that actually works I guess? 

* Use the <a href="https://github.com/Hyrdaboo/unity-rigidbody-fps/blob/main/BasicController.cs">Basic Controller</a> if you just need a quick controller with walking and stuff. Also this one is newer.
* <a href="https://github.com/Hyrdaboo/unity-rigidbody-fps/blob/main/FpsController.cs">FpsController.cs</a> has a lot more features but is older and trickier to setup.

And inside the folder **Not Fpscontroller** I have random assets I made for myself.

Pick whatever you like
